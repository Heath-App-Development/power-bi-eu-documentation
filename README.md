# Documentation Overview

## Purpose

This set of documents will help guide users through the various Power BI reports published by Heath. To make navigation easier, each report has it's own entry in the Table of Contents.

The intent is to consolidate all the information that will help users get the most out of Power BI. As time allows, the existing documents that are scattered in various places will be moved here.

## Accessing Power BI content

Power BI content is available as apps inside Power BI, or as free-standing reports.  Apps are meant mainly when there are several related reports that should be viewed together.  The SBU Management and SBU Field Supervisor Power BI apps are two examples of apps.  Occasionally a standalone report might be shared with you too.

Rather than go into detail about how to see content in the Power BI service online, please refer to [this blog post](https://heathus.sharepoint.com/sites/powerbitipstricksandanswers/SitePages/Finding-your-way-in-Power-BI-online.aspx) instead.

## Report refresh schedule

The reports that make up the app are set to refresh automatically. This means that at the times listed below, they will read whatever information is in the data sources, go through the report script, and then update in the app.

The refreshes can take anywhere from 1 to 30 minutes depending on what kind of data source the information is kept in, how much information needs to be processed, and how complicated the script is to get the raw info into the report.

If you have just put information into a data source and don’t see it in the app yet, it is most likely because the refresh process hasn’t completed yet.

All times are shown in CST:

* 6:00 AM
* 8:00 AM
* 10:00 AM
* 12:00 PM
* 2:00 PM
* 4:00 PM
* 6:00 PM
* 8:00 PM

The only exception is the HELIX report. Its first refresh is at 5:00 AM Central Time and there is no 8:00 PM refresh. Otherwise it follows the refresh schedule listed above.
